# Countdown Clock
This program allows a user to choose a specific date and time then initializes a countdown until the specified 
date and time has been reached. After the user has chosen a date and time, the program compares the specified time 
to the current time in order to provide an accurate countdown. If the specified date and time has passed, the program 
provides the user with input and a prompt to exit the program; otherwise, the program prints the remaining time left 
on the countdown every ten seconds until the chosen date and time has been reached.
